Docs.Hyperfy.xyz is a living community resource for [Hyperfy v2.](https://github.com/hyperfy-xyz/hyperfy)

It will continue to evolve as Hyperfy v2 progresses. (with your help! 🚀)

Easily add resources in markdown to the appropriate .md or .mdx file.  If needed, create a new file.  Be sure to start with frontmatter format of all others, for templates go to `src/templates` and copy paste into appropriate folder.  Add folder if needed.


For sidebar and routing, you will need to add to astro.config.mjs. Order is based on astro.config.mjs.  Easiest is to copy from above and edit.  You can have nested sidebars.  You can have an index.md/mdx in a nested folder.

For example, `guides/web3` will direct to `guides/web3/index`.  You don't need to say index, and it will url to guides/web3.

For images, recommend to convert to .webp [Image Magick is one great way](https://imagemagick.org/)  or [Photopea is another](https://www.photopea.com/).  Both free and open-source tools.

Drop images in `public/assets`

`[![name](/assets/photo.webp)](/assets/photo.webp)` in .md/.mdx file will display image and allow it to be clicked to enlarge.


For embeds, badges, asides - check the `/src/templates/example.mdx`

## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro + Starlight project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
.
├── public/
├── src/
│   ├── assets/
│   ├── content/
│   │   ├── docs/
│   └── content.config.ts
├── astro.config.mjs
├── package.json
└── tsconfig.json
```

Starlight looks for `.md` or `.mdx` files in the `src/content/docs/` directory. Each file is exposed as a route based on its file name.

Images can be added to `src/assets/` and embedded in Markdown with a relative link.

Static assets, like favicons, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
